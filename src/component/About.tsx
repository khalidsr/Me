                <p>
                During my time at 1337 School,
                I have delved deep into the world of software development and system operations,
                acquiring a comprehensive understanding of various tools and methodologies that streamline the development process.
                My experiences have instilled in me the importance of efficient collaboration and the significance of fostering a culture of continuous integration and delivery.
